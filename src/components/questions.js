        ques: 'Introduction to UAX Governance',
        ans: <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>A famous proverb is, If you govern well, then all is well. UAX governance promises to empower users, developers, validators, and stakeholders to collectively benefit from the protocol. Rather than relying on centralized leadership, UAX employs a transparent, rules-based structure to propose, discuss, and implement changes, thereby giving the ecosystem durability and autonomy.
        </p>

    conceptGovernance: {
        ques: 'What is Governance?',
        ans: <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>
           In decentralized systems, governance refers to how decisions are made and enforced. It defines who is responsible for making protocol upgrades, how conflicts are resolved, and how new ideas are incorporated into the network. For UAX, governance isn't an afterthought — it's a foundational layer that keeps power distributed and the network future-proof.
        </p>

    decentralized: {
        ques: 'Decentralized Governance',
        ans: <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>
           True decentralization means more than just running nodes. At UAX, governance is built into the network, enabling participants to propose changes, contribute to debates, and vote on-chain — all without granting disproportionate influence to centralized entities. This system prevents stagnation
        </p>

    UAXGovernance: {
        ques: 'UAX Governance in Practice',
        ans: <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>
The UAX governance model combines programmable rules, consensus mechanisms, and stakeholder feedback loops. Token holders and contributors participate via community proposals, binding votes, and public deliberation. The result is a living protocol shaped by those who use and build it.        </p>
    },
    chainGovernance: {
        ques: 'Onchain vs offchain governance',
        ans: <>
            <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>
                On-chain governance is so far the best option as it utilizes the blockchain itself for voting and enforcing decisions, thereby creating transparency, immutability, and automation.
            </p>
            <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px] italic'>
Off-chain governance, meanwhile, focuses on human coordination, including community discussions, working groups, and informal consensus. UAX merges both, using off-chain coordination to ideate and on-chain processes to execute, ensuring decisions are efficient yet democratic.            </p>

               Staking is the process of locking UAXN tokens to support the operation and security of the UAX network. Unlike traditional mining, our model is powered by validator hardware that regularly submits proof of activity — earning rewards for every live contribution.

            <p className='font-extralight mb-0 mx-0 lg:text-[16px] text-[12px]'>
               Staking your UAXN provides you with the opportunity to earn passive rewards, support network decentralization, and participate in governance decisions. The more consistently your validator submits shares (~742 every 2 minutes), the more reliable your earnings become.

              Staking your UAXN is simple and flexible. Whether you're running your own validator or delegating to a service, the process is designed to be user-friendly and rewarding. All you need is a supported wallet, your UAXN tokens, and a method that fits your level of experience — from solo setups to staking pools.
